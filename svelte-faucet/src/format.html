        <p>In most of the charts, hovering over an image shows the code point
          and name, and clicking on the image goes to the respective row in
          the Emoji
          List chart. Emoji images without available skintone show a small swatch afterwards;
          those without available images are shown as ✘.
          Each image has the respective character as an “alt”
          value, so copying the image into plain text should (OS permitting)
          give the plain text character for that image.
